# Tranpose

**Transpose** is an extension for **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** for transposing selections or characters. It is similar to the _transpose_ feature in **[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)**. This is currently under development. So it is not available in the plugin repository.
